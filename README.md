## Constructors in Java

Java constructors or constructors in Java is a terminology been used to construct something in our programs. A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. 

In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory. It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object. Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

### How Constructors are Different From Methods in Java? 
* Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined while it is not necessary for the method in Java.
* Constructors do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
* Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.
